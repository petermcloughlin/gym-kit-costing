# Pete's Gym Kit Costing App
Welcome to Pete's Gym Kit Costing,
This application is a gym set costing app which takes some user input, calculates their BMI and returns a recommended gym kit set and cost. The live app is accessible in the following  [link](https://gym-kit-costing-194b49d03f96.herokuapp.com/)
The purpose of the app is to take the following input from the user:

* height in cms
* weight in kgs
* age in years
* gender ( m / f )
* work out schedule in hours

Based on the user's input, their BMI is calculated and a summary  of their details in relayed back to the user interface along with a recommended gym kit set of dumbells, barbell and cost.

## Features
The app consists of a series of questions which use validation to ensure their input contains valid entries. Once submitted, the user's responses are appended to a customer array within the application. The response are collated, so a BMI is calculated and the summary data is returned to the terminal for the user to see, along with a recommended gym kit and cost. It also allows the user to re-run a calculation with new user inputs at the end when the user is asked if they would like restart the app or not.

The following screenshots display a flow of the questions asked and validation responses when invalid input is submitted in each instance.
